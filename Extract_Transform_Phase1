## Intro:

In this notebook, follow the python code to extract and transform raw property sales data into a python list format. My own commentary surrounding certain pieces of code is denoted by the '#' symbol.

### Raw data files repository and technical documentation:

Source of raw dataset: https://valuation.property.nsw.gov.au/embed/propertySalesInformation

*You can download data files in weekly batches (if the files pertain to property data from the current year), or in yearly increments (for years prior to the current year). The files come in zip format and include multiple .DAT files (thousands if you are downloading yearly zip files).*

Please review the terms and conditions relating to this raw dataset via the above and below links.
